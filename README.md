# What

Reposity with exercises I wrote while studying Go.

# Where they came from?

Most of them was from [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1).

Others were my idea or recommended by colleagues and/or friends.

# How to use?

1. Have go installed on your machine
2. On your terminal run the following command changing the folderName with the one you want to build:

`$ go build -o bin folderName/*.go`

3. Then run your compiled application

`$ ./bin/folderName`
